# 🧊 Fridgy

Fridgy is your **family’s fridge buddy** 🥕🥛🍕. It helps everyone know what’s in the fridge, what’s running low, and what to grab at the store — without sticky notes or endless group chats.

## ✨ What It Does

* **Create Fridges** → one for the kitchen, one for the garage freezer, even one for the snack cupboard 🍫.
* **Add Items** → just scan the barcode 📷 or type it in. Track how many you have and when it’s time to restock.
* **Share with Family** → invite the whole crew 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 so everyone sees updates in real time.
* **Shopping List Magic** → mark things you need, check them off at the store, and watch them pop back into the fridge list.
