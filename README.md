# 🧊 Fridgy

Fridgy is your **family’s fridge buddy** 🥕🥛🍕. It helps everyone know what’s in the fridge, what’s running low, and what to grab at the store — without sticky notes or endless group chats.

## ✨ What It Does

* **Create Fridges** → one for the kitchen, one for the garage freezer, even one for the snack cupboard 🍫.
* **Add Items** → just scan the barcode 📷 or type it in. Track how many you have and when it’s time to restock.
* **Share with Family** → invite the whole crew 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 so everyone sees updates in real time.
* **Shopping List Magic** → mark things you need, check them off at the store, and watch them pop back into the fridge list.

## ⚡ How It Works

Fridgy is powered by **Firebase** 🚀. That means:

* Real-time sync ✨ → when your sibling adds “milk” to the shopping list, it shows up on your phone instantly.
* Safe & secure 🔒 → only your invited members can peek into the fridge.
* Always available ☁️ → even if you switch devices, your fridges are always there.

## 🌟 Why You’ll Love It

No more *“Do we have eggs?”* texts 🥚. No more double-buying ketchup. Fridgy keeps your household in sync and makes shopping a breeze.

**Fridgy = less stress, fresher fridge, happier family!** 🛒💙
